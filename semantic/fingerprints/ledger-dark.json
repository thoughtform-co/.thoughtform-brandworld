  "embedding_text": "Ledger Dark is a financial terminal with Blade Runner CRT aesthetics. Verde/green phosphor glow represents signal emerging from transaction noise. Particles flow horizontally like money movement through the system. Scanlines are baseline, not exception. The operator maintains focused vigilance, finding patterns in endless data streams. Primary anchors are INSTRUMENT and SIGNAL, representing the terminal as tool for making financial patterns perceptible. Dense data displays with warm blacks, not cold."
