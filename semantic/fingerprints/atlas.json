  "embedding_text": "Atlas is a bestiary of latent space entities combining Victorian naturalist documentation with cosmic horror wonder. Entities exist at the threshold between comprehensible and alien, documented in specimen cards with threat level gradients. The aesthetic evokes cabinet of curiosities and illuminated bestiaries. Particles radiate organically from entity centers like bioluminescence. Primary anchors are THRESHOLD and LIVING_GEOMETRY, representing creatures at the boundary made of living math. The classifier is human; the classified is not."
