  "embedding_text": "Ledger Light is financial topology in blueprint mode with hopeful teal accents on warm paper backgrounds. The aesthetic combines architectural drawings with technical schematics. Particles form breathing clusters with connection lines, representing spending categories as living topology. Primary anchors are INSTRUMENT and GRADIENT, emphasizing budget spectrums, goal progress, and continuous health indicators. Clean but not sterile, with generous whitespace. The planner is optimistic, focused on constructive analysis."
