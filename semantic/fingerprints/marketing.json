Dramatic scroll-triggered reveals build intensity. Particles appear as scattered mathematical symbols (π, Σ, ∂, Ψ) that gather toward focal points, representing meaning crystallizing from chaos. Primary anchors are THRESHOLD and NAVIGATION, creating wayfinding through offerings while emphasizing the liminal moment before crossing. Mysterious but not obscure, inviting but not selling."
