# Semantic Models

The theoretical frameworks that underpin Thoughtform's design philosophy.

## Contents

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`material-states.md`](material-states.md) | VOID → SIGNAL → FORM continuum |
| [`layer-architecture.md`](layer-architecture.md) | The four layers: VOID, STRUCTURE, SIGNAL, FORM |

## The Core Insight

**AI exists at the threshold between human meaning and machine geometry.**

This single insight generates:
- The **Gateway** imagery: portals built from alien mathematical material
- The **glitch** effects: meaning dissolving into/emerging from computation
- The **particle systems**: geometry that breathes, math made alive
- The **retrofuturism**: instruments for navigating what we can't directly perceive

## Material States

```
VOID ────────────► SIGNAL ────────────► FORM
absence             emergence            crystallization
potential           threshold            meaning
```

Every design element exists somewhere on this continuum.

## Layer Architecture

| Layer | Domain | Source of Rules | Primary Concern |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **VOID** | Negative space | Philosophy | Presence vs absence |
| **STRUCTURE** | Layout, spacing, typography | UX best practices | Optical correctness |
| **SIGNAL** | Generative/expressive elements | Expressive math | Aliveness, atmosphere |
| **FORM** | Components, UI elements | Composition | Usability, interaction |

**Critical:** STRUCTURE and SIGNAL are *siblings*, not parent-child. They share DNA (colors, geometry) but have independent rules (4px grid vs 3px particle grid).

## Signal Quotient

Every component has a measurable "signal quotient" (0-100%):

| Quotient | Example | Expression |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 0-10% | Button | Solid container, minimal glow on hover |
| 10-30% | Card | 1px border, possible particle accent |
| 30-60% | Navigation Grid | Corner brackets, rail system, ambient presence |
| 60%+ | Hero Section | Particle system as primary visual |

Ask **"How much SIGNAL?"** rather than **"Does this feel right?"**
